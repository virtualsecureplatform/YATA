The main Test\&Measurement script is `oneshottest.py`.

`testvectors/` directory includes the fixed dataset (input ciphertexts and evaluation key) we used for performance measurement. 

The measured data is located in `log/` directory.
If you installed bzip2 on your machine, running `decompress_pickles.sh` decompresses them.  

After decompression, by running `measured_plot.py`, you can reproduce our Fig. 4 and 6. Because we retouched Figure 6 for readability, you may notice some differences, but this is expected.
